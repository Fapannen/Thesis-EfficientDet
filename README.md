# Thesis-EfficientDet

## Fast object detection on mobile platforms using neural networks

This is the main repository of my Bachelor's Thesis.

### Structure
  * `automl` is an official EfficientDet ([Original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09070), [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xuannianz/EfficientDet)) repository, used as a submodule. Some of original scripts are used to export model to tflite format.
  * `thesis` is a folder containing all of my work.
